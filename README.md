v4lweb v0.2
====

v4lweb is a simple way to publish video4linux devices to the Internet at large.

It's under heavy development at this time and is not recommended for production use. It does, however, work.

NOTES
====
Bootstrap **2.0** needs to be used, as 2.0.1 has a bug when less runs in the browser.
